# Deep learning-based feature selection for single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis

In this work, we explore the utility of various deep learning-based feature selection methods for scRNA-seq data analysis. We sample from Tabula Muris and Tabula Sapiens atlases to create scRNA-seq datasets with a range of data properties and evaluate the performance of traditional and deep learning-based feature selection methods for cell type classification, feature selection reproducibility and diversity, and computational time. Our study provides a reference for future development and application of deep learning-based feature selection methods for single-cell omics data analyses.
